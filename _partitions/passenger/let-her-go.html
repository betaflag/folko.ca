Em                            C 
Staring at the bottom of your glass
        D                          Bm 
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
                Em               C         D   D 
The dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes

Maybe one day you'll understand why
               Em           C        D   D 
Everything you touch all it dies

Same old empty feeling in your heart
