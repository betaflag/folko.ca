[Verse 1]
C                                Am
Gazing through the window at the world outside
C                              Am
Wondering will mother earth survive
F                              Dm               G  Gsus4 G
Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her, sometime
 
C                               Am
After all there's only just the two of us
    C                                  Am
And here we are still fighting for our lives
F                         Dm                      G   Gsus4 G
Watching all of history repeat itself, time after time
 
[Chorus]
           C
I'm just a dreamer
  Am            Em  G  Gsus4 G
I dream my life away
           C
I'm just a dreamer
    Am               Em  G
Who dreams of better days
 
[Verse 2]
  C                               Am
I watch the sun go down like everyone of us
    C                                 Am
I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
  F                                    Dm             G   Gsus4 G
A better place for those Who will come after us, this time
 
[Chorus]
           C
I'm just a dreamer
  Am            Em  G  Gsus4 G
I dream my life away
           C
I'm just a dreamer
    Am               Em  G Gsus4 G
Who dreams of better days
 
[Bridge]
     Dm                         G     Gsus4 G
Your higher power may be God or Jesus Christ
   Dm                            G  Gsus4 G
It doesn't really matter much to me
        Dm                              G    Gsus4 G
Without each others help there ain't no hope for us
    Dm                      G   Gsus4 G
I'm living in a dream of fantasy, 
 
oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
C                              Am
If only we could all just find serenity
   C                                 Am
It would be nice if we could live as one
     F                               Dm          G   Gsus4 G
When will all this anger, hate and biggotry, be gone?
 
[Chorus 3]
           C
I'm just a dreamer
  Am            Em    G    Gsus4 G
I dream my life away, today
           C
I'm just a dreamer
    Am               Em    G  Gsus4 G
Who dreams of better days, oh yay
 
           C
I'm just a dreamer
      Am                Em   G    Gsus4 G
Who's searching for the way, today
           C
I'm just a dreamer
Am               Em    G        Gsus4 G     C
Dreaming my life away, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
